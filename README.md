  A Hybrid Algorithm for Mathematical Optimization Based on Artificial Immune System and Particle Swarm Optimization 
The aim of this research was to investigate if combining Particle Swarm Optimization and Artificial Immune Systems
to solve optimization problems is possible and if so to propose a design, implement it into working software and 
evaluate it against the component algorithms to see if the approach will provide overall increase in the 
performance and possibly gain a valuable insight of the process.
